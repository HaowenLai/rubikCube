# rubikCube
## description
This project uses kociemba algorithm to solve Rubik's cube.
It is used to automatically solve Rubik's cube by a device that is DIYed by my team, so it contain both software for upper monitor and lower driver(STM32).

## modules
This project contains the following modules:
- Simulation
- InOut monitor
- 3D turning effect
- STM32 driver

## usage
`I will complete this part later ^_^ `

****
The whole device (including hardware structure and software) is really remarkable!
Have fun and enjoy it ~~
